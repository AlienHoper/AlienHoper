# Hi!!! I'm Elena (Alyona) Speranskaia, a Game Design Generalist

I have built small C++ systems and game prototypes in UE5 using Blueprints.  
Here are a few of my coding projects:

## Projects
- **SimpleVector & ArrayPtr** — standard-like vector with a tiny move-only owner, iterators, inserts/erases.  
  → repo: https://github.com/AlienHoper/cpp_simple_vector

- **Mini C++ Preprocessor** — Recursively inlines `#include` (local & system), detects cycles; C++17 `std::filesystem` + `std::regex`.  
  → repo: https://github.com/AlienHoper/cpp_preprocessor

- **Simple Search Server** — Tiny in-memory search with stop-words, TF-IDF ranking, pagination, and request-queue analytics.
